DO THESE EVERYTIME YOUR ABOUT TO MAKE A NEW FEATURE OR CHANGE

Step 1: Get Latest GitHub Info
- git fetch origin

Step 2: Create Your Local Branch
- git checkout -b feat/login origin/dev

[checkout -b: Creates a new branch and switches to it.]
[feat/login: The name of your new local branch.]
[origin/dev: The starting point. This ensures you're using the "true" version of dev from GitHub, not an outdated local copy.]

Step 3: Publish Your New Branch to GitHub
- git push -u origin HEAD

[git push: Uploads your branch.]
[-u: This is the important part. It tells Git to create the local branch on your machine on GitHub and "link" your local branch to it.]
